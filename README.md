# ARTIFICIAL INTELLEGENT POWERED MULTIPLE DISEASE PREDICTION SYSTEM USING MACHINE LEARNING .
The rationale of this study lies in addressing the critical need 
for a comprehensive and accurate disease prediction system that can identify 
individuals at risk ofmultiple diseases, including diabetes, kidney disease, lung cancer, liver disease, 
and heart disease. The late detection and prognosis of these chronic conditions have significant implications for 
individual health outcomes, healthcare systems, and public health at large. By developing a web-based AI-powered multiple 
disease prediction system using machine learning, this study aims to bridge the existing gaps in disease prediction and improve healthcare strategies.
